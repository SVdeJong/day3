# my answer is different from the answer given in the course, since I already have some knowledge of for-loops. 
# one flaw in the code is if the first and/or second digit get a score of 10. Real world suggest this should be a 0 to 100 score, but this will then be exceeded. But the setup of the excercise is such that 1010 would be a valid score. Since it's outside the scope of the excercise, I'll leave it like this for now.
